# Contributing

This document describes the mechanics of our development process.

If you are unsure how to make a change, you can bring it up in our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/skill-collectors/weather-app). If it's a complicated issue that might require a long conversation, you can [create an issue](https://github.com/skill-collectors/weather-app/issues/new/choose) to have a separate place to have that conversation.

## Pull Request Process

We use the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) branching strategy.

Before opening your PR, ensure that all GitHub checks pass.

When you are ready, request a review from either a specific person/people or from the whole skill-collectors/weather-app-devs group. Someone will review and either request changes or approve.

Requesting approval assumes that the PR can be merged by the approver once approved. If you want someone to look at your PR, but you aren't ready for it to be merged, create a [draft Pull Request](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) and then `@mention` someone in the comments to get their opinion.
